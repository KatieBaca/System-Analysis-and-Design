DriverPass, owned by Liam, would like to provide remote up-to-date training to help students pass their written driving test and in-person on-the-road training to help pass their driving test. The system that Liam had in mind included a website for students to utilize remotely. The staff could use the same website in the office and remotely to complete their work as well. In addition to the website, considerations were made for the office operation and on the road driving lessons.

I interpreted DriverPass’ requests for the system well, only needing to make minor changes as the project progressed.

I could have added more notation to some of the diagrams created for these projects. Including 1 to many and many to many relationships where appropriate would have increased the amount of detail of each diagram.

To interpret DriverPass’ User Needs, I made bulleted lists as I read through the transcripted conversation between DriverPass and my consulting company. I read the transcript several times and organized the requests I noted. I made sure to consider each user and each process and what the end goal was for each User. If in the end, the stated goals cannot be accomplished we have failed to deliver a working system.

I approach designing software first by listening closely to the requests and requirements being made. I want to make sure that I check all the boxes being presented. If I can, I try to put myself in the position of the User to draw from my own experiences while still being open to better ways of accomplishing goals.
